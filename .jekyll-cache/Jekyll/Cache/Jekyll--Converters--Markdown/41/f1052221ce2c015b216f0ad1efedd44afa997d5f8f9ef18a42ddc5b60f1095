I"è<p>Although I‚Äôm a big fan of Tom Cruise but this article is not about the movie
from the Mission Impossible series. In this article, I discuss a paper by <a class="citation" href="#sompolinsky2015secure">(Sompolinsky &amp; Zohar, 2015)</a> in which they introduce a protocol called the
<em>GHOST</em> Protocol.</p>

<p>The paper presents an alternative called <em>GHOST</em> to Bitcoin‚Äôs Longest
Chain selection rule for resolving forks in blockchain. This
modification is proposed to allow increasing Bitcoin‚Äôs block creation
rate without making it vulnerable to attacks.</p>

<h2 id="need_for_speed">Speed-Security Tradeoffs</h2>

<p>In order for Bitcoin to be adopted as a global currency system, it must
scale to support a high volume of transactions. In order to achieve this
either block size or the block creation rate must be increased, both of
which pose security tradeoffs in the form of vulnerability to various
forms of attacks (e.g. double-spend attack, selfish-mining etc.) due to
difficulty in the synchronization of the ledger between various nodes in
time. <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="effect-of-increasing-block-size">Effect of Increasing Block Size</h3>

<p>If the block size is increased, it will take longer for new blocks to be
propagated throughout the network. The delay in propagation of new
blocks is proportional to the size of the blocks <a class="citation" href="#blockdelay">(Decker &amp; Wattenhofer, 2013)</a>. This
delay could lead to increase in frequency of forks.</p>

<h3 id="effect-of-increasing-rate-of-block-creation">Effect of Increasing Rate of Block Creation</h3>

<p>If the rate of block creation is increased, more blocks will keep
getting created while the block was being propagated leading to forks.
It should be noted that an adversary (assumed to be centralized) would
not suffer from such a delay.</p>

<h2 id="ghost-selection"><em>GHOST</em> Selection</h2>

<p>Consistency in Bitcoin is provided by the longest-chain rule which is
based on the fact that the chain with the hardest Proof-of-Work should
have been adopted by majority of the nodes in the system. This based on
the principle that since the adversary cannot provide a harder
Proof-of-Work than the honest network, the chain with the hardest
Proof-of-Work must have been adopted by the honest nodes.</p>

<p>An adversary could take advantage of the delay in block propagation to
present a longer chain that may not involve the hardest Proof-of-Work.
Hence, the adversary will be able to attack the blockchain with fewer
resources, reducing the security of the blockchain.</p>

<h4 id="greedy-heaviest-observed-sub-tree">Greedy Heaviest-Observed Sub-Tree</h4>

<p>Abbreviated as GHOST, extends this idea further to prevent wastage of
PoWs of out of sync nodes by including them in the chain-selection rule.</p>

<h3 id="growth-of-main-chain">Growth of Main Chain</h3>

<p>Suppose $\alpha$ be the fraction of computational power in a subset of
well-connected nodes. Let the delay diameter of the subset be $D$, the
maximum time taken by a block from one node to reach another in the
subset.</p>

<h4 id="longest-chain">Longest Chain</h4>

<p>With the longest chain rule the main chain grows with a rate of atleast
$\beta_\lambda \geq \frac{\alpha\lambda}{1+\alpha\lambda D}$</p>

<h4 id="ghost">GHOST</h4>

<p>With the GHOST chain rule the main chain grows with a rate of atleast
$\beta_\lambda \geq \frac{\alpha\lambda}{1+2\alpha\lambda D}$</p>

<p>Note that the growth is slower in GHOST because we have to wait for $D$
delay so that the new block gets propagated and no one creates block on
other subtrees.</p>

<h4 id="upper-bound">Upper Bound</h4>

<p>Due to network delays the growth rate is limited in both GHOST and
Longest Chain Rule. Let $S, T$ be two non-empty partitions of the
network such that $\forall s \in S \text{and} \forall t \in T$ delay
between $s$ and $t$ is atleast $d$ and let $P_S$ and $P_T$ be the
fractions of computational power possessed in the partitions
respectively. Then,
$$\beta_\lambda \leq \frac{(P_S \lambda)^2 e^{P_S \lambda 2 d} - (P_T \lambda)^2 e^{P_T \lambda 2 d}}{(P_S \lambda) e^{P_S \lambda 2 d} - (P_T \lambda) e^{P_T \lambda 2 d}}$$</p>

<h3 id="security_threshold">Security Threshold</h3>

<p>Maximum fraction of resources possessed by the adversary relative to the
honest network in order to have an exponentially high probability of a
$51\%$ Attack.</p>

<p>Let the computational power of the adversary be
$q\ \lambda_\text{honest}$ for some $q \in [0, 1)$.</p>

<p>Then, for longest-chain rule the security threshold is
$\frac{\beta}{\lambda_\text{honest}}$ but for GHOST it remains constant
at $1$. This is a consequence of the fact that forks still contribute to
the weight of the subtree at an overall rate which the adversary can not
match (while $q &lt; 1$).<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="related-work">Related Work</h2>

<p><a class="citation" href="#ghost_framework">(Kiayias &amp; Panagiotakos, 2016)</a> introduce a new formal framework for the analysis of
blockchain protocols that relies on trees (rather than chains) and also
propose an attack on the Liveness property.</p>
