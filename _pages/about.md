Hello, I'm Anurag Jain, a Computer Science undergraduate student at IIIT-Hyderabad.
I am a researcher at the Machine Learning Lab, IIIT-H working on Blockchains under Prof. Sujit Gujar.

#### Research Interests

I am working on solutions for scaling blockchains (see [Speed-Scalability Tradeoff]({% post_url 2019-10-17-need-for-speed %}#need_for_speed) for finding out why is this such a difficult problem) and ensuring fairness in transactions on a blockchain using game theory and mechanism design.

#### Hobbies

In my free time, I enjoy trekking, swimming, and traveling to new places, and I am fond of all sorts of adventures.
